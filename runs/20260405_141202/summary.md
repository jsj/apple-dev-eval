# Summary

Cost interpretation:
- `cost_*` = billed cost (includes cache discounts and any upfront tool schema overhead).
- `cold_cost_*` = cold-equivalent cost (treat cached reads as uncached for like-for-like A/B/C comparisons).
- `summary_cold.*` (when enabled) filters to runs where `cached_read_tokens == 0`.

MCP vs shell comparison:
- Use `cost_*` for overall cost (includes MCP schema overhead).
- Use `cold_cost_*` or `summary_cold.*` for like-for-like cost.
- Use `marginal_cost_usd` for work-only cost (baseline subtracted).
